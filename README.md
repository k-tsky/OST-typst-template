# OST Thesis Template (Typst)

A Typst template for theses and academic reports at the OST (Ostschweizer Fachhochschule).  
The template provides a structured setup for creating professional-looking documents with title pages, lists of figures/tables/code and localized support for English and German.

This project builds on top of the [unisg-thesis-template-typst](https://github.com/joshuabeny1999/unisg-thesis-template-typst) by [Joshua Beny](https://github.com/joshuabeny1999).  
A big thanks to the original author for the groundwork and inspiration!
